# CocomoCalculator

This project is a calculator that implements a software cost estimation model called COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model). The COCOMO model is used to estimate the cost, manpower requirements, and development time of software development projects.

**Project Types:**

- **Organic Projects:** Small-scale projects conducted by experienced staff (e.g., a human resources management system running on a LAN)
- **Semi-Detached:** Projects that have both an informational and hardware-driving component.
- **Embedded Projects:** Projects aimed at driving hardware (e.g., software controlling an unmanned aircraft - high hardware constraints)
