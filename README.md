# üßÆ Function Point + COCOMO Calculator (Windows Desktop App)

**COCOMO Calculator** is a Windows desktop application that estimates software development **effort**, **duration**, and **team size** by combining two models:

- **Function Point Analysis (IN)**
- **COCOMO Basic Model**

Developed in **C# (.NET Framework)** using Windows Forms.

> üì¶ Download the `.exe` directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/furkangenca/cocomo-calculator-desktop/releases) page.  
> ‚öôÔ∏è No installation required. Runs as a standalone Windows application.

## üß† How It Works

The app follows a 3-stage estimation flow:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Function Point Calculation (IN)

You provide:
- A list of **measurement counts** (e.g. number of inputs, outputs, interfaces‚Ä¶)
- A matching list of **weight factors** for each

The app computes **AIN (Unadjusted Function Points)** using:

```
AIN = ‚àë (Measurement[i] √ó Weight[i])
```

Then it evaluates 8 complexity-related factors (0‚Äì5 scale):

> e.g. *Does the app require backup/recovery?*  
> *Are there distributed operations?*  
> *Is performance critical?* etc.

These are summed as the **Technical Complexity Factor (TKF)**, and IN is calculated as:

```
IN = AIN √ó (0.65 + 0.01 √ó TKF)
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Source Code Size Estimation

Estimated **Lines of Code (LOC)** are calculated based on:

```
LOC = IN √ó 30  
KLOC = LOC / 1000
```

(Assumes average 30 LOC per Function Point)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ COCOMO Estimation

Based on selected **project type**, the app applies COCOMO's basic model:

| Type | Input Code | Description        |
|------|------------|--------------------|
| 1    | Organic     | Simple, small project with experienced team |
| 2    | Semi-Detached | Medium-size, mixed-experience |
| 3    | Embedded    | Complex, constrained system |

COCOMO Formulas:

```
Effort (K) = a √ó (KLOC)^b  
Time   (T) = c √ó (K)^d  
Avg. Team Size = Effort / Time
```

Constants (a, b, c, d) vary based on project type.

### üì§ Output Preview

Once you enter the inputs and hit the **"Cocomo Sonucunu Hesapla"** button, the application displays all calculated results:

- AIN (Unadjusted Function Points)
- TKF (Technical Complexity Score)
- IN (Adjusted Function Points)
- Estimated LOC
- KLOC
